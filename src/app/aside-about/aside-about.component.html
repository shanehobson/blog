          My name is Cameron Hobson. Iâ€™m a former professional baseball player and current Performance Product Engineer for a biotechnology engineering company in Columbus, OH. I specialize in creating biomechanics related technology to help people improve their performance.

          I created this blog because I get a lot of questions about how to improve baseball performance with engineering, physics, and biomechanics concepts. This blog lets me put those concepts out into the world where coaches and athletes apply them to their training and coaching.
