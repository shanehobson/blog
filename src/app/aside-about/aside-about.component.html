      <p>My name is Cameron Hobson.  Iâ€™m a former professional baseball player and current Human Performance Product Engineer for Bertec. 
        I specialize in bringing biomechanics related technology to people to help improve their performance.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am also a part time pitching coach.  I created this blog because I get a lot of questions about how to improve baseball performance through my unique perspective and knowledge of physics, engineering, and biomechanics concepts.  This blog lets me put those concepts out into the world where coaches and athletes can take them and apply them to their training & coaching.
